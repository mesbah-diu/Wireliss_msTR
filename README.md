# Wireliss_msTR

Its a Wireless cracking tool for accessing target wifi network.

I use some tools like airmon-ng, aerodump-ng, aircrack-ng to build this tool.

Its a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool and its very user friendly.

Clone it by "git clone https://github.com/mesbah-diu/Wireliss_msTR.git"

change directory by "cd Wireliss_msTR"

Clone it, change the password with "chmod +x binary.sh" and run it by simply typing ./binary.sh
